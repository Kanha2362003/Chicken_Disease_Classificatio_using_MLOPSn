üêî Chicken Disease Classification ‚Äî End-to-End Deep Learning Project with MLOps
This project presents a production-grade deep learning pipeline for image-based classification of chicken diseases, designed using modern MLOps best practices. It demonstrates the complete machine learning lifecycle ‚Äî from data ingestion and preprocessing to model training, versioning, CI/CD automation, and cloud deployment. The pipeline is implemented using a modular and scalable architecture, leveraging tools like DVC, GitHub Actions, and Docker, with deployment on both Azure App Services and AWS EC2.

üöÄ Project Overview
Problem Statement: Classify poultry diseases using deep learning to support real-time veterinary diagnostics.

Approach: Leveraged Transfer Learning with TensorFlow/Keras to build an efficient and high-accuracy image classification model.

MLOps Integration: Adopted DVC for tracking datasets, models, and pipeline stages, ensuring full reproducibility across environments.

CI/CD Workflow: Configured GitHub Actions for automating training, testing, and deployment pipelines.

Deployment: Containerized the FastAPI-based inference service using Docker, and deployed to production environments on Azure and AWS.
